# React_Multilanguages

## What we will cover?

* What do we need to consider when building an app for customers
* Custom features asked by customers
* Separating features from our customers.

## Notes:

When dealing with international apps or even apps that will be a little different for each customers it is vital to have a good strategy for feature toggling.

The most common strategy is using `if condition` to toggle different components on and off at runtime.

However, the issue with this method is that it gets very messy when we have a lot of custom components and customers only want to get what they really need.
